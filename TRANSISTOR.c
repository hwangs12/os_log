// remotely control switch, can control voltage

// NPN: swing gate controls water flow

// it's a technology of silicon

// consists of collector pin, base pin, and emitter pin

// NPN: higher voltage on base pin, transistor fully open

// emitter and collector are n-type

// base is p-type

// n-type: excess electron in silicon

// p-type: lack electron in silicon

// two different materials meet called np-junction
